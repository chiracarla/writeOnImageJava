# Image Processing in Java

This project is a simple Java application that helped me learn about image processing. It allows users to overlay a custom message onto a JPG image at its center. Users can choose to either modify the original image or save the edited version to a new file.

## Features
- Accepts a file path to a JPG image
- Allows the user to specify a message to overlay on the image
- Places the message at the center of the image
- Gives the option to either overwrite the original image or save the edited image to a new location

## How to Use
1. Run the application.
2. Provide the file path of the JPG image you want to edit.
3. Enter the message to be displayed on the image.
4. Choose whether to overwrite the original image or save the edited image to a new file.

## Learning Outcome
This project introduced me to basic image manipulation in Java, including:
- Reading and writing image files
- Drawing text onto images using Java's Graphics2D
- Handling user input for file paths and text messages

## Future Improvements
- Support for other image formats (PNG, BMP, etc.)
- Customization options for font, size, and color
- Longer message display
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction
